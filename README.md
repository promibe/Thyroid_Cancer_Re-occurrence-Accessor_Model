# Thyroid_Cancer_Re-occurrence-Accessor_Model


I aimed to develop a classification model that predicts the likelihood of thyroid cancer re-occurrence in patients. Using Python, I built a robust model that analyzes various factors to determine the risk of re-occurrence.

I utilized Pandas and NumPy to analyze the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify key features contributing to thyroid cancer re-occurrence. Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to visualize the data, revealing trends and patterns.

The model was trained using various classification algorithms, including CatBoostClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. After evaluation, the CatBoostClassifier emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98% with minimal error.

This model can help reduce the risk of re-occurrence and improve the quality of life for thyroid cancer patients. By accurately predicting the likelihood of thyroid cancer re-occurrence, a healthcare professional can take proactive measures to prevent or manage the disease, ultimately saving lives. My model has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of oncology.
